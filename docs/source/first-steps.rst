accessible account.

Jira/Confluence

Set up an account on Jira/Confluence via Google using your work email address.
Verify your email address using the link sent from Jira. Use the grid of nine
dots in the upper left corner to switch between Jira and Confluence.

discuss.openedx.org

Set up an account on discuss.openedx.org by selecting the Google Account option
using the Sign Up button in the upper right. Use a tcril.org email address or
SSO.

GitHub

Using your personal account for work now? Better change the email too. You will
be getting many notifications a day and you’ll want them all in one place. Use
the settings under email and notifications in Github to add your email address
and change where the notifications go. Be sure to enable 2 Factor 
Authorization.
